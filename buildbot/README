The directories slave/precise and slave/utopic are kept for historic reasons.
The buildbot @ http://buildbot.opencog.org:8010/ only uses slave/latest

### Steps
1. ./build-buildbot.sh # Builds all the images needed to setup build environment
2. ./stop-buildbot.sh # Stop any buildbot containers and remove them if any.
3. ./set-workspace.sh # If this is your first time then it configures space for
   the buildbot to work in. These directories are shared with the running
   containers.
4. ./run-buildbot.sh

### TODO:
1. Add relex unit testing
2. Add integration testing between opencog and relex
3. Add integration testing between opencog and unity3d-opencog-game
