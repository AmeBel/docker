## Work in progress

The purpose of the dockerfiles and other configuration files in this directory
is for packaging binaries for different operating-systems running on different
architecture.

The supported architectures are likely to be x86 and x64, and the OS are likely
to be debian-family, Fedora-family, arch-family, opensuse-family. This hasn't
been decided yet.
